# Minotaur
Minotaur drops you into a living labyrinth where walls shift and monsters emerge with every change. At the center of it all stalks the Minotaur, an unstoppable hunter that always knows your position. Survive waves of lesser foes, scavenge gear, and navigate the maze to escape its shifting traps.
