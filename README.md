Minotaur

Minotaur is a top-down survival game set in a living labyrinth. The maze is built on a large grid where each square represents a unit cell with toggleable walls. Every so often, walls shift based on randomness, altering the paths available and creating new opportunities or traps.

One player takes the role of the hunted, whose goal is to reach the center of the labyrinth and escape via a visible ladder. The other role is the Minotaur, who always knows the hunted’s location and relentlessly pursues them from the far side of the maze. The shifting walls can help or hinder either side, sometimes breaking line of sight or forcing a longer route.

Gameplay
- Maze Structure
    - Giant grid of unit squares.
    - Each square has four toggleable walls (north, south, east, west).
    - Periodically, random walls shift, changing the maze’s layout.

 - Roles
    - The Hunted: begins at one edge, must reach the escape ladder in the center.
    - The Minotaur: starts opposite, always knows where the hunted is, and moves to intercept.

 - Visibility
    - Top-down perspective.
    - Cells a certain distance away from the hunted are occluded to limit sight.
    - Some equipment can expand this vision range.

 - Encounters
    - Small monsters spawn randomly after shifts.
    - Combat is resolved by dice rolls modified by equipment.
    - Monsters can kill the hunted or be defeated for survival.

 - Equipment
    - Found in random chests.
    - Includes:
      - Torches or lenses to increase sight range.
      - Weapons to increase damage.
      - Armor to absorb more hits.
      - Potions to restore health.
      - Boots to increase speed.

Win Conditions
  - The Hunted wins by reaching the center and climbing the ladder.
  - The Minotaur wins by catching the hunted before they escape.

Core Loop
1. Walls shift at intervals → monsters spawn.
2. The hunted moves toward the ladder but may need to retreat or circle to avoid the Minotaur.
3. Encounters with monsters or chests provide risk and reward.
4. The Minotaur relentlessly closes in, using its knowledge of the hunted’s position.
5. Game ends when the hunted escapes or is caught.
