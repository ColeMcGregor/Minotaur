Minotaur

Minotaur draws directly from Greek mythology. In the legend, King Minos of Crete imprisoned the monstrous Minotaur within a vast Labyrinth designed by the master craftsman Daedalus — a maze so cunningly built that no one who entered could ever find the way out. Each year, Athens was forced to send sacrifices into this prison, where they would wander until the beast inevitably hunted them down. Only Theseus, aided by Ariadne’s thread, ever escaped.

This game reimagines that myth as a shifting, living labyrinth. The maze is built on a giant grid, with walls that randomly move, opening and closing paths like Daedalus’s trap come alive. At the far edge, the Minotaur lurks, always aware of the hunted’s position, relentless in pursuit. At the center lies the escape ladder, the only way out, always visible but never easy to reach. The hunted must survive monsters, gather equipment, and use shifting walls to their advantage, while the Minotaur’s goal remains simple: catch them before they escape.

Gameplay
- Maze Structure
    - Giant grid of unit squares.
    - Each square has four toggleable walls (north, south, east, west).
    - Periodically, random walls shift, changing the maze’s layout.

 - Roles
    - The Hunted: begins at one edge, must reach the escape ladder in the center.
    - The Minotaur: starts opposite, always knows where the hunted is, and moves to intercept.

 - Visibility
    - Top-down perspective.
    - Cells a certain distance away from the hunted are occluded to limit sight.
    - Some equipment can expand this vision range.

 - Encounters
    - Small monsters spawn randomly after shifts.
    - Combat is resolved by dice rolls modified by equipment.
    - Monsters can kill the hunted or be defeated for survival.

 - Equipment
    - Found in random chests.
    - Includes:
      - Torches or lenses to increase sight range.
      - Weapons to increase damage.
      - Armor to absorb more hits.
      - Potions to restore health.
      - Boots to increase speed.

Win Conditions
  - The Hunted wins by reaching the center and climbing the ladder.
  - The Minotaur wins by catching the hunted before they escape.

Core Loop
1. Walls shift at intervals → monsters spawn.
2. The hunted moves toward the ladder but may need to retreat or circle to avoid the Minotaur.
3. Encounters with monsters or chests provide risk and reward.
4. The Minotaur relentlessly closes in, using its knowledge of the hunted’s position.
5. Game ends when the hunted escapes or is caught.
